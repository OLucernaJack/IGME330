couldnt get classes to work somehow

Added audio effects: highshelf and lowshelf

Class name is Sprite, it was supposed to bob up and down when its using frequency data, and left and right when its using time data

i added title, audio name, and audio file location, didn't get a chance to add them to the js

removed gradient bg, added rgb noise, made circles and rotating bars change size based on volume volume level

I would grade myself maybe a 10-12% on the canvas itself, but maybe 5% on the UI

This is not my best work, as I got stuck on lowshelf because I couldn't identify if lowshelf was even working
and ran out of time to make sure everything was in a working order.
